# Tasks: LifeHacker Energy-First Productivity (Backend + React Native)

**Input**: Design documents + Current backend analysis + React Native migration plan
**Current Backend State**: ✅ Auth + User + Energy domains implemented, ❌ AI/Progress/External Integration domains needed
**Strategy**: React Native development with existing NestJS backend integration

## Execution Flow (Backend + React Native)
```
1. Backend Analysis Complete ✅
   → Existing: Auth (Google OAuth, JWT), User (profile CRUD), Energy tracking (complete domain)
   → Missing: AI recommendations, Progress visualization, External integrations
2. React Native Setup Required ❌
   → React Native 0.75+ + TypeScript + Zustand + TanStack Query + React Native Reusables
3. Development Strategy ✅
   → Phase 1: React Native project setup + auth integration
   → Phase 2: Energy tracking UI + AI recommendations backend
   → Phase 3: Progress visualization + external integrations + polish
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [B/M] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[B]**: Backend task (life-hacking-api/) - **ALWAYS reference @life-hacking-api/CLAUDE.md for development**
- **[M]**: Mobile task (life-hacking-mobile/)
- **Integration Tests**: Contract and E2E testing between backend and mobile

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `life-hacking-api/src/` (NestJS Clean Architecture + DDD + Hexagonal)
- **Mobile**: `life-hacking-mobile/src/` (React Native Container/Presentational)

## Development Guidelines

### Backend Development Rules
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: All backend development MUST follow the guidelines in `@life-hacking-api/CLAUDE.md`:
- Use **Clean Architecture + DDD + Hexagonal Architecture**
- Follow **CQRS** pattern (separate command/query repositories)
- Apply **Sequential Thinking** for complex problems
- Use **Symbol-based Dependency Injection**
- Follow **DTO patterns** with proper validation layers
- Maintain **Constitution compliance** (TDD, library-first, simplicity)

### React Native Development Rules
- Follow **Container/Presentational** pattern strictly
- Use **TypeScript 5.0+** with strict mode
- **Zustand** for client state, **TanStack Query** for server state
- **React Native Reusables** for UI components (shadcn/ui style)
- **NativeWind** for styling
- **Jest + React Native Testing Library** for testing
