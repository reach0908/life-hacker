- **Resource Flexibility**: Can prioritize epics based on user needs and resources
- **Reduced Risk**: Advanced features don't block core functionality

## Technical Architecture Validation

### Backend (NestJS) - Basic Features
- âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Domain â†’ Application â†’ Infrastructure â†’ Presentation layers
- âœ… **DDD Patterns**: User, EnergyLevel, Routine, Progress entities with proper boundaries
- âœ… **CRUD Operations**: Standard create, read, update, delete for all core entities
- âœ… **TDD Compliance**: All tests written before implementation

### Mobile (Flutter) - Basic Features
- âœ… **Feature Architecture**: Clean separation by domain (auth, energy, routines, progress)
- âœ… **State Management**: Riverpod for predictable state updates
- âœ… **Online-Only**: Simple HTTP API calls without offline complexity
- âœ… **Standard UI**: Form inputs, lists, basic charts without advanced animations
