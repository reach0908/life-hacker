## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Comprehensive PRD with detailed feature requirements provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: tech workers, energy-based productivity, routine recommendations, burnout prevention
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major unclear aspects - PRD is comprehensive
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows defined based on daily morning/evening routines
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements are testable based on PRD specifications
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Energy levels, routines, user profiles, external app data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details included, focused on business value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A tech worker (developer, product manager, designer) wants to maintain high productivity while preventing burnout by having their daily routines automatically adjusted based on their current energy levels and contextual data from their work tools and health metrics.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user feels tired (energy level 2/5) in the morning, **When** they input their energy level, **Then** the system recommends lighter activities like 15-minute stretching instead of intense workout
2. **Given** a user has had 3 consecutive high-intensity work days, **When** the system analyzes their pattern, **Then** it automatically suggests a recovery-focused routine to prevent burnout
3. **Given** a user has many GitHub commits this week, **When** generating daily recommendations, **Then** the system suggests eye rest activities to counter screen time
4. **Given** a user completes their adapted routine, **When** they mark it complete, **Then** their progress path shows this as intentional growth rather than reduced performance
5. **Given** a user's calendar shows back-to-back meetings, **When** planning the day, **Then** the system reduces the intensity of other recommended activities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external app integrations are unavailable (offline mode)?
- How does system handle conflicting data (calendar shows free time but user reports exhaustion)?
- What occurs when a user consistently reports low energy for extended periods?
- How does the system differentiate between temporary fatigue and potential health issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements *(Implementation Status as of 2025-09-15)*
- **FR-001**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST allow users to input their daily energy level using a 5-point scale (üò¥üòêüòäüî•ü§í)
- **FR-002**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST generate personalized daily routine recommendations based on energy level and contextual data
- **FR-003**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** System MUST integrate with external productivity tools (GitHub, Linear, Notion, Google Calendar, Apple Health)
- **FR-004**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST detect potential burnout patterns and proactively recommend recovery activities
- **FR-005**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** System MUST visualize user progress through a "Productivity Path" that treats rest as intentional growth
- **FR-006**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST adapt routine difficulty based on current energy (40% reduction for very tired, 50% increase for peak energy)
- **FR-007**: üîÑ **PARTIAL** System MUST provide daily evening reflection and progress tracking capabilities (backend ready, UI pending)
- **FR-008**: üîÑ **PARTIAL** System MUST maintain user streaks for energy level input to encourage consistent engagement (logic implemented, UI pending)
- **FR-009**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** System MUST offer both free and premium subscription tiers with different feature sets
- **FR-010**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST support offline functionality with basic rule-based recommendations
- **FR-011**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** System MUST provide comprehensive insights and analytics about user patterns and improvements
- **FR-012**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST respect user privacy and provide transparent data usage policies (JWT-based auth)
- **FR-013**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** System MUST send configurable push notifications for routine reminders and reflections
- **FR-014**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** System MUST allow users to customize and create their own routine activities
- **FR-015**: üîÑ **PARTIAL** System MUST track and celebrate "self-compassion" achievements (tracking implemented, celebration UI pending)

### Key Entities
- **User Profile**: Individual using the app, contains preferences, subscription tier, onboarding progress, and energy tracking history
- **Energy Level**: Daily energy assessment (1-5 scale) with optional mood context and timestamp
- **Routine Recommendation**: AI-generated daily activity suggestions with difficulty level, estimated duration, and category (work, exercise, rest)
- **Activity**: Individual tasks within routines (exercise, meditation, work blocks) with completion tracking
- **External App Data**: Synchronized information from productivity and health tools (commits, meetings, sleep quality, step count)
- **Progress Path**: Visual representation of user's productivity journey showing adaptive goals and self-compassion milestones
- **Insight Report**: Weekly and monthly analytics showing energy patterns, completion rates, and growth recommendations
- **Burnout Risk Assessment**: Calculated score based on activity intensity patterns and energy trends
- **User Settings**: Personalization preferences including notification times, connected apps, privacy choices, and routine categories
