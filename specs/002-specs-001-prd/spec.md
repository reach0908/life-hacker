# Feature Specification: LifeHacker Energy-First Productivity App - Documentation Update

**Feature Branch**: `002-specs-001-prd`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Documentation Update
**Input**: User description: "현재 전체적으로 @specs/001-prd-lifehacker-energy/ 의 모든 문서들을 업데이트해야해, 지금 구현되어있는 것들과 구현되지않은 것들을 확실히해서 스펙 문서부터 태스크문서까지 전체적으로 업데이트가 필요해 만들려고하는 것은 기존과 동일해 목표도 동일하니 그동안 개발이 꽤 많이 되어서 문서들을 전체적으로 업데이트할 필요가 있어"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Request for comprehensive documentation update based on current implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: Implementation status assessment, specification alignment, documentation synchronization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No unclear aspects - clear request for documentation update
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ Developer workflow scenarios for maintaining accurate project documentation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ All requirements focused on documentation accuracy and maintainability
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ Documentation entities, implementation status tracking
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ Focused on documentation management, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for documentation update execution)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT documentation needs updating and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for project maintainers and development stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A development team working on the LifeHacker energy-first productivity app needs accurate, up-to-date documentation that reflects the current implementation status across all specification documents, plans, and task lists to ensure proper project management and development continuity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** significant development progress has been made, **When** reviewing project documentation, **Then** all specification documents accurately reflect what has been implemented versus what remains to be done
2. **Given** new team members joining the project, **When** they read the specification documents, **Then** they can clearly understand the current state of implementation and remaining work
3. **Given** stakeholders need project status updates, **When** they review the documentation, **Then** they can accurately assess completion status and timeline estimates
4. **Given** development continues iteratively, **When** tasks are completed, **Then** documentation is maintained in sync with actual implementation progress
5. **Given** architecture decisions have been finalized during implementation, **When** reviewing technical documentation, **Then** all documents reflect the actual implemented architecture patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when implementation differs significantly from original specifications?
- How does the system handle documentation updates when multiple feature branches are active?
- What occurs when dependencies between documented features change during implementation?
- How are breaking changes in implementation reflected across all related documentation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST accurately reflect the current implementation status of all backend domains (auth, user, energy-tracking, routine-recommendations)
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST clearly distinguish between completed features and pending implementation work
- **FR-003**: Specification documents MUST be updated to reflect actual technology choices made during implementation (React Native vs Flutter, specific architecture patterns)
- **FR-004**: Task documentation MUST show accurate completion status with implementation dates and quality metrics
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST maintain consistency across all related files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, data-model.md, contracts/)
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST reflect the current Clean Architecture + DDD + Hexagonal Architecture implementation patterns used in the backend
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST accurately represent the Container/Presentational pattern implementation in the React Native mobile app
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST include current test coverage metrics and quality assurance status
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST reflect the actual API endpoints implemented and their current functionality
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST show the current state of mobile app features including authentication, energy tracking, and offline capabilities
- **FR-011**: Documentation MUST indicate which external integrations are implemented versus planned
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST reflect current development environment setup and dependencies
- **FR-013**: Documentation MUST show actual user flow completeness and any gaps in implementation
- **FR-014**: Documentation MUST maintain version history of significant architectural or feature changes
- **FR-015**: Documentation MUST be structured for easy maintenance and future updates as development continues

### Key Entities
- **Specification Document**: Current feature requirements with implementation status markers
- **Implementation Status**: Tracking completed, in-progress, and pending development work
- **Backend Domain**: Implemented NestJS domains with Clean Architecture (auth, user, energy-tracking, routine-recommendations)
- **Mobile Feature**: React Native features with Container/Presentational pattern implementation status
- **API Endpoint**: REST endpoints with current functionality and test coverage
- **Task Documentation**: Development tasks with completion status, dates, and quality metrics
- **Architecture Documentation**: Actual implemented patterns (Clean Architecture, DDD, Hexagonal, CQRS)
- **Integration Status**: Current state of mobile-backend integration and external API connections
- **Test Coverage**: Unit, integration, and contract test implementation status
- **Development Environment**: Current setup requirements and dependency versions
